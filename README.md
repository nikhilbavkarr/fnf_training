Day 1 : Basics, Enum , Class And Object , Array
Hackathon for C# Program: 1. Word frequency counter allows you to count the frequency usage of each word in your text. Write a program to find the word and its frequency.  Input  A text (alphabets i.e. a-z, A-Z)  Output  If the input doesnâ€™t contain even a single alphabet, print 0. For all other valid cases, print the frequency followed up by the word. The first line will print the word with highest frequency; the second line will print the word with next lower frequency value and so on. If two words have equal frequency, it will be prioritized by reverse alphabet order. Sample Input: Hello World. This is a nice World.  Sample Output  2 world  1 this  1 nice  1 is  1 hello  1 a 2. Librarian has a list of books and their authors as a text. You need to write a program to assist him. Write a method that prints the output as the book titles are sorted based on the alphabetical order of their author names and book titles.  The Function signature: List<String> SortTitles (List<String>) {}   Assumptions & Limitations:  1. A title will not contain the double quote (") character.  2. If a book contains more than one author, consider only the first author name for sorting.  3. If two books have same first author, use the book title for sorting.  4. Book titles are unique.  Sample Input (List containing the following three entries)  Sample Output (List containing the following three entries)  "The Canterbury Tales" by Chaucer  "Algorithms" by Sedgewick  "The C Programming Language" by Kernighan and Ritchie  The Canterbury Tales  The C Programming Language  Algorithms
